# AI Instruct

> Practical markdown guides for developers building websites with AI coding assistants.

Each guide opens with plain-English questions so AI assistants can tailor output to the specific project rather than generating generic boilerplate. Covers SEO, AWS deployment, Google Analytics, and web accessibility.
